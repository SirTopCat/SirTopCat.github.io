        I'm Casey Shearer. I'm a junior in high school, and I'm in the marching band.
        I play euphonium and trumpet, and I used to play clarinet and sax. I also take Tae Kwon Do.
        <br><br>
        On a normal weekday, I go to school for 7 hours, go home, and do whatever activity I have that day. <b>Mondays</b> and <b>Thursdays</b>, I head somewhere to eat before marching band rehersal. Sometimes that can be home, or to a food place like Chipotle. <b>Tuesdays</b> I go to Tae Kwon Do, <b>Wednesdays</b> and <b>Fridays</b> are for chilling.
        <br></br>
        I have a pupper at home named Madison. She happens to be scared of everything. Big scurrrred
