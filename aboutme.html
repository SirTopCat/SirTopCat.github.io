        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <br></br>
        I'm Casey Shearer, and I am a junior in high school.
        I've played Euphonium for three years, and play in the PDHS Marching band and Wind Ensemble.
        I used to play clarinet and sax, but playing with 3 fingers is easier than playing with all 13 of them.
        I've been doing Tae Kwon Do for 7 years.
        <br><br>
        On a normal weekday, I go to school for 7 hours, go home, and do whatever activity I have that day.
        <b>Mondays</b> and <b>Thursdays</b>, I head somewhere to eat before marching band rehersal.
        Sometimes that can be home, or to a food place like Chipotle.
        <b>Tuesdays</b> I go to Tae Kwon Do, <b>Wednesdays</b> and <b>Fridays</b> are for chilling.
        <br></br>
        I have a pupper at home named Madison. She happens to be scared of everything, but she's still a happy dog.
